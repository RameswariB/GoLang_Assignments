Write a program that displays the price of a cinema ticket according to the age of the client and the day of the week.

It should display the price of the ticket, the amount (in $) of discount applied, the age of the client, and the day of the week (in letters).

The base price of a ticket is $9.

The day of the week is to be encoded as an integer: 1 for Monday, â€¦, 7 for Sunday.

Younger than 16 years, or
65 years and older	10%	30%	30%	30%	10%
